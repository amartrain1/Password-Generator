## Description

I made a website to help make passwords for users.

## Usage

The user will begin by clicking on the red 'Generate Password' button. There will then be a prompt for the user to select a number between 8 and 128 characters. If the number is outside of that criteria, an error message will show and the user will again be prompted to select a number. The user will then be asked to select a number of character sets (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). After that, the password will be generated in the dotted box.
